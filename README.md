# About
This C program creates an empty circular singly linked list and lets the user insert a value to the front or delete a value from the list. After deleting the value, the list is printed and either an error (if the value doesn't exist) or the list after deletion is printed.

# Usage
Open terminal in the downloaded folder, enter "make", then an executable "main.exe" is created which you can launch by entering ".\main".
